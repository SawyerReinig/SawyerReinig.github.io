line 4, two html tags is not ok
line 7, need to close the <head> tag
line 9, didn't close h1 tag
line 11, didn't open paragraph tag <p>
line 13, you gotta pick a list type, this tag is different than the closing tag. 
line 19, used a closing tag: </li> to try and open a list item
line 24, not sure if this counts but once again different tag than opening of list. should be </ol>
line 26, didn't close paragraph tag
line 27, should have alt text for image. Also uncapitalize the i in Image so it knows what file to grab
line 29, change </img> to the closing a tag </a>

line 53, close comment with -->
line 55, didn't close a tag, need </a>
line 57, fix order of tags to:     <p><em>Underlined text</em></p> also should use <u> not <em> for underlined text
line 60 and 61, these are the wrong tags for this kind of list

move html tag from line 6 to line 2. 
use line 6 to close head tag
move the h1 ourside of the head. Nothing should be displayed in the head

line 17, need to use <!-- --> to make it a real comment.
need to close the div tag on line 9 at some point.

Would also like to mention that the formating needed some work here, but that's not really an error.
